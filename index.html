      <h3>Mission Statement</h3>

      <h3>Other Course Policies</h3>

      <h4>Communication and Device Usage</h4> <p>Coming to my office hours is the best way to get my undivided attention. When you can't make it to office hours to ask a question, contact me through Moodle messaging or my college email address. If you message me after 5pm or on the weekend, I may not respond until the next weekday.</p>

      <p>Our course content obviously lends itself to the classroom use of laptops, tablets, and phones; I expect to make use of Moodle during class as well. However, I expect you to demonstrate your respect for yourself and others by limiting your use of these devices to classroom-relevant activities. In particular, use of email, social media, or the general web is not acceptable unless I specifically ask you to. I reserve the right to erase one or more daily quiz scores because of inappropriate device usage.</p>


      <h4>Final Exam</h4>
      <p>Below is the final exam policy from  page 53 of the MOE:</p>
      <p>4. Examinations:</br>
        a. Course examinations and quizzes are to be given during the regular class period as specified in the syllabus. Instructors should not give a unit exam during the last week of classes if they have scheduled a final exam during exam week.</br>
        b. Final examination week is included in the calculation of credit hours required by the College’s accreditor. Therefore, exams must be administered during the designated time period of each final exam week. Early final examinations are not permitted. If the course does not require a final exam, a class meeting must be scheduled during the designated period or another assignment requiring no less than 2.5 hours of student work per course credit must be scheduled.</p>


      <h4>Email</h4> <p>Students are expected to read their Alma College email on a daily basis. Important (and time-sensitive) messages about this class and other campus updates could be sent at any time, and email is one of the most common channels for sharing that information. I may not respond to emails sent after 5pm or on the weekend until the next business day.</p>

      <h4>Academic Integrity</h4> In view of the college’s commitment to ethical integrity, it must take strong exception to behavior which is untruthful. Academic dishonesty includes the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Plagiarism</li>
        <li>Exchange of information on examinations</li>
        <li>Assistance in the completion of an exam, writing of essays or laboratory reports</li>
        <li>Computer software theft</li>
        <li>In particular, if I determine that part or all of a submitted problem set was copied from another, or that students collaborated on the problem sets, <em>all</em> students involved will get a <b>zero</b> on the assignment. You are responsible for safeguarding your work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Disciplinary action following dishonesty is handled by the faculty member. It may result in failure of the course involved. All infractions and actions will be reported to and recorded in the Provost’s Office. Repeated evidence of academic dishonesty is reviewed by the Provost and may involve more severe penalties.</p>

      <p>In general, I will encourage collaboration during class, but I also expect you to demonstrate your ability to work effectively on your own. If you have questions about my policies and/or the <a href="https://www.alma.edu/student-handbook/section-ii/academic-dishonesty-policy/">College's policies</a>, don't hesitate to ask.</p>

      <h4>Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility</h4>
      <p>I am  committed to creating an inclusive classroom that respects a wide range of experiences, viewpoints, and abilities. Please don't hesitate to talk with me or the Center for Student Opportunity (see below) if there is anything I can do to increase your opportunities for learning in our classroom.</p>


      <h3>Campus resources</h3>
      <h4>Accommodations for students with disabilities</h4> <p>Alma College is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities for persons with disabilities.  If you have a disability and you would like to request accommodations, please see Rhonda Lynn (<a href="mailto:linnrm@alma.edu">linnrm@alma.edu</a>) in the Center for Student Opportunity (CSO) so that such accommodations can be considered.  If you currently receive accommodation letters from the CSO, please meet with me outside of class to discuss the provisions of those accommodations as soon as possible.</p>

      <h4>Writing Center</h4> <p>For support with your writing projects, please visit the Alma College Writing Center, which strives to assist Alma student writers at all levels of experience and in any course or major.  Peer writing consultants work one-to-one with students to help at any stage of the writing process -- from brainstorming to drafting to revising to editing a final draft.  The Writing Center is located in the library near the Smith Room, and it is open during the fall and winter semesters:  Mondays thru Thursdays from 2-5 and 6-10 pm and on Sundays from 7-10 pm.  Hours are limited during exams week.  To schedule an appointment, please stop by during the Center's open hours or visit <a href="http://www.alma.mywconline.com">www.alma.mywconline.com</a>.</p>

      <h4>Tutoring</h4> <p>Tutoring is available for this course through the Center for Student Opportunity (CSO).  Please stop by the CSO and complete a tutor request form (yellow) located by the front door.   You will be matched with a faculty recommended tutor within a couple of days of your request.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding tutoring, please contact Rhonda Linn (<a href="mailto:linnrm@alma.edu">linnrm@alma.edu</a>).</p>

      <h4>Career Development</h4> <p>Career development can do more than help you with the job application process.  Our Career Coaches are equipped to help you figure out what academic pathways make the most sense given your goals for after graduation.  If you have questions about how to prepare for life after college please make an appointment with Maddie Moeggenborg (<a href="mailto:moeggenborgmm@alma.edu">moeggenborgmm@alma.edu</a>).</p>

      <h4>Diversity and Inclusion Office</h4> <p>The Office of Diversity and Inclusion at Alma College strives to provide opportunities for students to learn about self and others while creating spaces for each of us to be our most authentic selves. The diversity programming should challenge and encourage us to move beyond our comfort zones. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion is a space and resource for all students, staff, faculty and administrators to learn about our differences and how to be intentionally inclusive.  For more information, or to get involved, please contact the Director of Diversity and Inclusion, Dr. Donnesha Blake at <a href="mailto:blakeda@alma.edu">blakeda@alma.edu</a>.</p>

      <h4>Civil Rights and Title IX</h4> <p>Alma College complies with all relevant federal and state laws banning discrimination in private institutions of higher education. Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act are designed to protect equality of educational opportunity for all students and of employment for all faculty and staff. The full set of policies and procedures that the college has established to protect these rights are consolidated into a single document available at this link: <a href="https://www.alma.edu/live/files/3195-civil-rights-policy-november-2018"> https://www.alma.edu/live/files/3195-civil-rights-policy-november-2018</a>.  For more information, please contact our Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator Kevin Carmody at <a href="mailto:carmodykd@alma.edu">carmodykd@alma.edu</a>.</p>

      <h4>Starfish</h4> <p>Alma cares about your success! This course utilizes the Starfish Student Success platform. Starfish is an online notification system used by faculty to communicate with students and support personnel regarding academic achievements and to identify areas for improvement. In addition to awarding kudos to acknowledge excellent performance, Starfish is also used by faculty and staff to raise early alerts and to direct students to free resources such as tutoring, supplemental instruction, or career services. Starfish referrals are designed to help students identify strategies to achieve their academic goals. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the many opportunities offered at Alma to promote academic success. To access Starfish, log into inside.alma.edu<a href="http://inside.alma.edu"></a>  and click the Starfish link.  To learn more about Starfish, contact Rhonda Linn (<a href="mailto:linnrm@alma.edu">linnrm@alma.edu</a>) in the CSO.
